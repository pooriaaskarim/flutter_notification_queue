/// Controls when and how the close button appears on notifications.
///
/// The close button's visibility is expressed as an **opacity** value
/// (`0.0`–`1.0`) rather than a boolean, enabling smooth animated transitions
/// and platform-adaptive behavior without explicit device detection.
///
/// ### Implementations
///
/// | Behavior         | Resting | On Hover | Touch Devices          |
/// |------------------|---------|----------|------------------------|
/// | [AlwaysVisible]  | `1.0`   | `1.0`    | Always fully visible   |
/// | [VisibleOnHover] | `0.3`*  | `1.0`    | Subtly visible (0.3)   |
/// | [Hidden]         | `0.0`   | `0.0`    | Invisible, untappable  |
///
/// *`VisibleOnHover` uses [progressive enhancement]: it starts at `0.3`
/// (safe for touch), then upgrades to true hide/reveal (`0.0`/`1.0`)
/// once a mouse hover event is detected.
///
/// ### Zombie Prevention
///
/// [Hidden] removes the close button entirely. If used, the queue **must**
/// provide at least one other dismissal method (drag or long-press drag),
/// or [ConfigurationManager] will throw an [ArgumentError].
///
/// See also:
/// - [ConfigurationManager._validateInputResilience], which enforces this.
sealed class QueueCloseButtonBehavior {
  /// Creates a close button behavior.
  const QueueCloseButtonBehavior();

  /// The button's resting opacity before any interaction.
  ///
  /// Returns a value between `0.0` (invisible) and `1.0` (fully visible).
  double get initialOpacity;

  /// Returns the target opacity in response to a mouse hover event.
  ///
  /// [isHovering] is `true` when the pointer enters, `false` when it exits.
  ///
  /// This is driven by [MouseRegion], which only fires for mouse pointers —
  /// never for touch. On touch-only devices, this method is never called
  /// and the button remains at [initialOpacity].
  double onHover({required final bool isHovering});
}

/// The close button is always fully visible (`1.0`), on every platform.
///
/// This is the default behavior and the safest choice — the button is
/// always visible and always tappable.

/// NotificationQueue.defaultQueue(
///   closeButtonBehavior: const AlwaysVisible(), // default
/// )
/// ```

/// The close button uses **progressive enhancement** to adapt to the
/// user's actual input device:
///
/// 1. **Before any hover**: the button renders at `0.3` opacity —
///    visible enough to discover and tap, but visually de-emphasized.
/// 2. **On first mouse hover**: the system detects that a mouse is present
///    and permanently upgrades to true hide/reveal (`0.0` → `1.0`).
/// 3. **After upgrade**: the button is fully hidden at rest and appears
///    only on hover, matching desktop conventions.
///
/// This approach is **evidence-based** rather than platform-based:
/// - A Surface Pro in tablet mode → no hover fires → stays at `0.3` ✓
/// - The same Surface Pro with a mouse → hover fires → upgrades ✓
/// - An iPad with a Magic Keyboard trackpad → hover fires → upgrades ✓
